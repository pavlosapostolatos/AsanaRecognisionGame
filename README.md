# Asana Recognision Game


If you wanna know yoga instead of just doing yoga you need to know what you are doing.

This is driver's license style test, suitable even as a kid's game to sharpen your memory of the Asana Names.

## How to play:

Fill up the Images folder with pictures. The name of the asana the game asks for is the filename of the pictures so name them like you want to appear in game.
